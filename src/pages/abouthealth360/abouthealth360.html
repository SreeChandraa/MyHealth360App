    <ion-title>About Health 360º</ion-title>
    <h6>Version 1.0</h6>
    <body>
      <p>
            There are a lot of applications out in the market that are in the social space, few on the
          educational space and a handful of utility applications that serve various segments of the
          industry/people.<br>There are no apps out there on the Healthcare domain that would serve as a one stop
          shop for the medical needs although there are independent applications that has very selective
          features and doesn’t cover the end to end life cycle.<br>
            A user has to maintain a lot of medical records (paper,files) , Insurance and related
          documents and then use online apps to order medicines or buy it from the store. There is no
          easy way to organize these and reference it at any point of time for the subsequent health
          checkups or seeking Second/Third Opinions. Maintaining this as a family health portfolio
          opens up even more challenges.<br> On the other hand, hospitals do have their own home grown software solutions or saas
          subscriptions that would help them track patients and doctor visits which will solely benefit
          the hospitals to a large extent.The intention of Health 360º is to
          put the solution to use in the market and this would be the first of its kind where all of the end
          to end modules of a health care system will be in a single mobile app.
